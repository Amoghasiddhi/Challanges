# The definition of a Quine by wikipedia
> "A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output."

# A word before my solution:
By the nature of the problem I had to be able to:
* Make newlines and quotation marks without special characters(\n and \")
* Carefully craft the output,so the code and output matched up

# Now my solution:
* I replaced newlines with the integer 10 and quotation marks with the int 34

# For begginers:
* the %c char and %s string definitions within my string let me append chars,strings later on which was how I added the newlines and quotation marks later to it

# Opinion:
The challange is really fun,and forces you to really understand the string manupulating methods of your language,while being entertaining
